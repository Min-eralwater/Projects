# Hi there! Overview of what you will find here -

1. Fashion MINST Classification Comparison: As this is a group project, I worked largely on the unsupervised learning sections of the project, MLP and Le-net5. (Also helped with our modified version of Le-net5, Jo-net5) 

2. Exploring the Naive Bayes vs SVM classification approach for sentiment analysis in social media context

3. Clinic queue simulation is a small project done to simulate the queues of patients at a clinic and to figure out if there is a real need for addition of staff. 

4. Bunker Fraud was a project done in school with industry collaboration - to identify vessels with suspicious behavior using CBLOF, DBSCan and other methods.
